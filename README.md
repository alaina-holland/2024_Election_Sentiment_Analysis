# 2024_Election_Sentiment_Analysis
Analyzing public sentiment for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election using social media data.


## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze public sentiment towards presidential candidates in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election using social media data. The goal is to understand voter attitudes and predict potential election outcomes. Originally inspired by the June 27, 2024, Biden-Trump Debate, we chose to pivot to understand the true online public opinion of the Democrat Nominee [presumably Kamala Harris] and the Republican Nominee Donald Trump.
